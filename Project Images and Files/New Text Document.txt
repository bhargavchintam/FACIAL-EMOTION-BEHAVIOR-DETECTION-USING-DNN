step 1: Input Face Images, Videos, stream
step 2: Preprocessing the Face Images
	a. Face Detection and Segmentation
	b. Aligning & Cropping
	c. Color to Grayscale
	d. Eigen Faces
	e. Catpuring Features
Step 3: Feature Extraction from Images
	a. feature based appraoch/appearance based approach
	b. object detection and template building (Testing)
	c. Matching with trained dataset utilizing CPU (GPU if available)
	d. improving trained dataset (Training)
step 4: Classification Methods
	a. Binary Classification or Multi-label classification
	b. Decision Algorithm
step 5: Final Prediction with output frame
